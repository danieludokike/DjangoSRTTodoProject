# Minimal Django To-Do App 📝

A clean, fast, and minimal To-Do list application built with **Django**. This project features a **Single-Page CRUD** design, allowing users to create, read, and delete tasks primarily from one main screen, with minimal dedicated pages for editing and deletion confirmation.

## ✨ Features

* **Single-Page Listing:** View all tasks and submit the **Create** form from the same primary page (`task_list.html`).
* **Full CRUD:** Complete **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete functionality.
* **Minimalist Design:** Uses basic HTML and **Bootstrap** (via CDN) for a clean, mobile-friendly interface.
* **Safe Deletion:** Uses a dedicated confirmation page for the **Delete** operation to prevent accidental data loss.
